# Airline Queue ADT

This program executes and outputs the total length of the simulation, the maximum lengths of
the first class queue and coach class queue, the maximum service time for a passenger, the
average service time for a passenger, and the number of first and coach class passengers in an
airline check in queue.

The flow of the program is as follows: an abstract queue is created in the Check_In_Queue
class that creates a queue array which holds the size and arrival times for passengers. It
implements a queue interface that enables the addition to a tail and removal of the head from
the queue. The Passenger class is the abstract data class that creates the passenger object
and determines if the passenger is a first class passenger or not. It also provides a random
arrival time method in the case of a non-average case arrival time. Along a similar vein, the
ServiceStation class class does all the things the passenger class does but also adds
passengers to service stations and removes them from the queue. ServicedPassengers is a
class that removes passengers from the service stations and records the maximum and average
times it took for a passenger to be completely serviced. The simulator class simulates and runs
the aforementioned classes and returns the data for arrival rates and times and number of
passengers in first and coach classes.
